ABSTRACT:
The main techniques in physically storing information in a ``Quantum superposition state'' and inducing ``entanglement'' amongst pairs of ``Qubits'' are (a) trapped ions, (b) superconducting circuits (e.g. Unimon Qubit), (c) Nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond, and (d) Photonic Qubits.  Each of these vehicles for quantum information technology have their advantages and disadvantages.  Important properties to consider are (i) resiliance to noise, (ii) ability to communicate ``quantum'' information over long distances, (iii) decoherence time, (iv) operating temperature, (v) scalability of multi Qubit entanglement, and (vi) being amenable to strategic control.  Right now, Quantum computers are in the ``Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum'' (NISQ) era.  In an effort to constantly improve the design of quantum computers, scientists and engineers answer questions regarding the aforementioned Qubit technology either experimentally or computationally.  In this review article, it is the computational methods which are reported on.  It is the objective of this review article to serve as a reference on the subject matter of ``Numerical Methods for Engineering Quantum Computers'' for use by students and established researchers.  As a side benefit, it is expected that understanding the mathematical models and computational algorithms used to engineer Quantum Computers will also lead to improved algorithms for utilizing Quantum Computers.

As quoted from Shalf\cite{shalf2020future},
``Moore’s Law [1] is a techno-economic model that has enabled the IT industry to double the performance and functionality of digital electronics roughly every 2 years within a fixed cost, power and area. This expectation has led to a relatively stable ecosystem (e.g. electronic design automation tools, compilers, simulators and emulators) built around general-purpose processor technologies, such as the ×86, ARM and Power instruction set architectures. However, within a decade, the technological underpinnings for the process that Gordon Moore described will come to an end, as lithography gets down to atomic scale. At that point, it will be feasible to create lithographically produced devices with dimensions nearing atomic scale, where a dozen or fewer silicon atoms are present across critical device features, and will therefore represent a practical limit for implementing logic gates for digital computing [2]. Indeed, the ITRS (International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors), which has tracked the historical improvements over the past 30 years, has projected no improvements beyond 2021, as shown in figure 1, and subsequently disbanded, having no further purpose. The classical technological driver that has underpinned Moore’s Law for the past 50 years is failing [3] and is anticipated to flatten by 2025, as shown in figure 2. Evolving technology in the absence of Moore’s Law will require an investment now in computer architecture and the basic sciences (including materials science), to study candidate replacement materials and alternative device physics to foster continued technology scaling.'' 
\par\noindent
References one through three in the above quote 
correspond to the following references respectively: 
\cite{moore2021cramming}\cite{mack2015multiple}\cite{markov2014limits}.
\par\noindent
In Figure 3 of the article by Shalf\cite{shalf2020future}, a roadmap is provided for possible paths forward when the density of circuits on classical computers exceeds a critical value.  There are three categories: (a) roadmap for the next ten years, (b) 20 years, and (c) ``Decades beyond exascale,'' ``New Models of Computation.'' For category (c), some of the prospective technology listed is:
(i) approximate computing, (ii) adiabatic reversible, (iii) Analog, (iv) Neuromorhic, and (v) quantum.
\par\noindent
Of the ``new models of computation'' listed in 
Shalf's article\cite{shalf2020future}, this review article will address
the ``Numerical Methods for Engineering Quantum Computers'' aspects associated with the emerging ``quantum computing'' paradigm.  As outlined by
Gamble\cite{gamble2019quantum}, the development of reliable quantum
computers will have a tranformative effect on computer technology.  That being said, right now we are in the ``Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum''\cite{callison2022hybrid} (NISQ) era.  The purpose of this review article is to bring to the forefront the current research being done, from the computational perspective, in order to move beyond the NISQ era.

\section{preliminaries}
In order to appreciate the complexities associated with designing a quantum computer, it is suggested that one first gain some intuition on electricity and magnetism.
\par\noindent
Classical electromagnetism is a very complex topic, in of itself.  One could choose as a starting point Maxwell's equations which are,
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:gauss_law_e}
    \nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} &= \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0} \quad \text{(Gauss's Law for Electricity)} \\
    \label{eq:gauss_law_m}
    \nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} &= 0 \quad \text{(Gauss's Law for Magnetism)} \\
    \label{eq:faraday_law}
    \nabla \times \mathbf{E} &= -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} \quad \text{(Faraday's Law of Induction)} \\
    \label{eq:ampere_maxwell_law}
    \nabla \times \mathbf{B} &= \mu_0 \left( \mathbf{J} + \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t} \right) \quad \text{(Ampere-Maxwell's Law)}
\end{align}
Also, there is the Lorentz force law:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\textbf{F} = q(\textbf{E} + \textbf{v} \times \textbf{B})
\end{eqnarray*}
Maxwell's equations and the Lorentz force can be formulated in such a way as to satisfy the invarience condition under the rectilinear Lorentz transformation:
\begin{eqnarray*}
t'=\gamma(t-\frac{vx}{c^{2}}) \\
x'=\gamma(x-vt) \\
y'=y \\
z'=z \\
\gamma=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-v^{2}/c^{2}}}
\end{eqnarray*}
\par\noindent
A good textbook that describes these fundamentals is by Purcell and Morin third edition\cite{purcell2013electricity}.
%https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/
\par\noindent
Maxwell's equations, and relativity though are not sufficient to describe the
quantum nature of matter and light.  Matter and Light, when considering
small enough scales, have a dual particle and wave property to them.  Also
Matter and light posess discrete ``quantum,'' energy levels.
For a good reference, see the following quantum mechanics 
textbook\cite{sakurai2020modern}.  Experiments which cannot be
explained by classical electromagnetism are the
%demonstrates that the magnitude of the angular momentum is quantized.
Stern-Gerlach experiment\cite{gerlach1989experimentelle}, 
the photo-electric effect\cite{wheaton1978philipp}, and
the electron double slit experiment\cite{bach2013controlled}.
%%photons interacting with thin membrane?
\par\noindent
The mathematical model that describes the dynamics of matter and light, including ``quantum'' properties and the dual particle wave property is Schrodinger's equation:
\begin{eqnarray*}
i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \Psi(\mathbf{r}, t) = \hat{H} \Psi(\mathbf{r}, t)
\end{eqnarray*}
where:
i is the imaginary unit
$\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant
$\frac{\partial}{\partial t}$ is the partial derivative with respect to time
$\Psi(\mathbf{r}, t)$ is the wave function
$\hat{H}$ is the Hamiltonian operator
$\mathbf{r}$ is the position vector
$t$ is time
The time-independent Schrödinger equation can be written as:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\hat{H} \psi(\mathbf{r}) = E \psi(\mathbf{r})
\end{eqnarray*}
where:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\hat{H} 
\end{eqnarray*}
is the Hamiltonian operator
\begin{eqnarray*}
\psi(\mathbf{r}) 
\end{eqnarray*}
is the time-independent wave function
\begin{eqnarray*}
E 
\end{eqnarray*}
is the energy of the system.

If relativistic effects must be considered then the following relativistic wave equation models have been developed:
\begin{itemize}
\item Klein Gordon equation (spin zero particles) (flat space time)
\begin{equation}
\left(\frac{1}{c^2}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2} - \nabla^2 + \frac{m^2 c^2}{\hbar^2}\right) \phi(x,t) = 0
\end{equation}
\item Klein Gordon equation (spin zero particles) (in terms of the four-dimensional derivative operator (d'Alembertian))
\begin{equation}
\Box \phi(x) + \frac{m^2 c^2}{\hbar^2} \phi(x) = 0
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\Box=\frac{1}{c^{2}}\frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial t^{2}}-\nabla^{2}
\end{equation}
\item Dirac equation (spin one half particles)
\begin{align}
& \left(\beta m c^2 + c \left(\sum_{n=1}^3\alpha_n p_n\right)\right) \psi(x,t) = i\hbar \frac{\partial \psi(x,t)}{\partial t}\\
& i\hbar\gamma^\mu \partial_\mu \psi - mc\psi = 0 \\
& (i\slashed{\partial} - m)\psi = 0
\end{align}
\end{itemize}

Finally, in some scenarios, the most appropriate mathematical models 
correspond to the nonlinear Schrodinger equation:
\begin{eqnarray*}
i\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t} = -\frac{1}{2} \nabla^2 \psi + V(\psi) \psi
\end{eqnarray*}

Feynman path integral\cite{beau2012feynman}
Relativistic Feynman path integral\cite{struckmeier2024relativistic}

For the applications of quantum computing and quantum information 
processing, it is argued that relativity effects can be ignored since
the rest energy possessed by an electron is $E=m_{e}c^{2}$ which is 
significantly larger than the energy required for inducing a 
superposition state or the energy to carry out a unitary operator on a
current quantum state.

``Quantum computers operate on energy levels far below those where relativistic effects become noticeable. The speeds of qubits and the interactions between them are slow enough that the effects of time dilation and length contraction are practically insignificant. ''

Indicates the timeframe in which the special issue could be produced (to include paper writing, reviewing and submission of final copy to the journal) assuming the proposal is accepted;
Includes a short biography of all authors and guest editors;
Indicates any special timing, associated events, funding support, partnerships or other links or relationships which could influence the development of the issue;
Provides any further information which you feel is relevant.
A special issue normally contains between five and 20 full-length articles, in addition to an editorial written by the special issue organizers. Because it is highly unlikely that all articles submitted for potential inclusion in a special issue will successfully pass the peer review process, it is wise to consider more papers than you anticipate as the upper limit. If fewer than three articles are accepted for publication, the articles will be published as stand-alone articles in the journal.
Once you're ready, use the link below to find your chosen journal and submit your proposal.

The following is a template for inviting researchers to contribute to the special issue: \\
\par\noindent
Dear first and last name, \\
\par\noindent

In response to the growing interest in Quantum Computing, and the constant effort to design ever more resilient systems, we plan to publish a Special Issue on ``Numerical Methods for Engineering Quantum Computers'' in the Journal of Computational Physics (JCP). This Special Issue will span a broad range of related topics from numerical methods for determining ground states, numerical methods for solving the unsteady or nonlinear Schrodinger Equation, Density Functional Theory, Computer Aided Design of Quantum Algorithms in order to optimize the ``decoherence time,'' Hybrid classical quantum algorithms, and optimal design and control of qubits. Our special issue will serve as a complete reference on the subject matter for use by students and established researchers. \\

\par\noindent
Given your expertise in the related field, we extend a personal invitation to you to contribute a paper to this Special Issue on a topic of your choice. If agreeable, please send us a reply by Email with a tentative title by 22 November, 2024. Please copy Ms Yuan Li (yuan.li@elsevier.com) who is copied on this Email and happy to answer any questions you may have. Please see below details about the submission portal and other relevant information. \\
