ABSTRACT:
The main techniques in physically storing information in a ``Quantum superposition state'' are (a) trapped ions, (b) superconducting circuits (e.g. Unimon Qubit), (c) Nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond, and (d) Photonic Qubits.  Each of these vehicles for quantum information technology  have their advantages and disadvantages.  Important properties to consider are (i) resiliance to noise, (ii) ability to travel long distances, (iii) decoherence time, (iv) operating temperature, and (v) scalability of multi Qubit entanglement.  Scientists and Engineers answer questions regarding the aforementioned Qubit technology either experimentally or computationally.  In this review article, it is the computational methods which are reported on regarding Quantum information technology and engineering.  That being said, many numerical techniques synergistically use experimental data in order to discover quantum phenomena; i.e. many numerical methods have a data assimilation (i.e. data fusion) component.

Pre-submission
Unless you have been approached directly by the Editor-in-Chief of a journal or another member of its editorial or publishing team, you will need to submit a proposal to guest edit a special issue to the relevant editorial office. If you are contemplating a special issue proposal, you might find the following recommendations helpful.
Preparing a proposal for a special issue
Working together with any other guest editors, you should prepare a proposal that, in addition to observing any special guidelines which are imposed by the journal's guide for authors or special issue guide (if any):
Sets out the importance of the area on which the special issue will focus;
Explains how the anticipated contribution of the special issue will advance understanding in this area;
Identifies papers and authors for possible inclusion in the special issue, with a brief description of each paper. (These papers do not need to have been written at this time, although it might be the case that work is already in progress.);
Indicates the timeframe in which the special issue could be produced (to include paper writing, reviewing and submission of final copy to the journal) assuming the proposal is accepted;
Includes a short biography of all authors and guest editors;
Indicates any special timing, associated events, funding support, partnerships or other links or relationships which could influence the development of the issue;
Provides any further information which you feel is relevant.
A special issue normally contains between five and 20 full-length articles, in addition to an editorial written by the special issue organizers. Because it is highly unlikely that all articles submitted for potential inclusion in a special issue will successfully pass the peer review process, it is wise to consider more papers than you anticipate as the upper limit. If fewer than three articles are accepted for publication, the articles will be published as stand-alone articles in the journal.
Once you're ready, use the link below to find your chosen journal and submit your proposal.
