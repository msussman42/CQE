ABSTRACT:
The main techniques in physically storing information in a ``Quantum superposition state'' and inducing ``entanglement'' amongst pairs of ``Qubits'' are (a) trapped ions, (b) superconducting circuits (e.g. Unimon Qubit), (c) Nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond, and (d) Photonic Qubits.  Each of these vehicles for quantum information technology have their advantages and disadvantages.  Important properties to consider are (i) resiliance to noise, (ii) ability to communicate ``quantum'' information over long distances, (iii) decoherence time, (iv) operating temperature, (v) scalability of multi Qubit entanglement, and (vi) being amenable to strategic control.  Scientists and Engineers answer questions regarding the aforementioned Qubit technology either experimentally or computationally.  In this special issue, it is the computational methods which are reported on.  It is the objective of this Special Issue to serve as a complete reference on the subject matter of ``Numerical Methods for Engineering Quantum Computers'' for use by students and established researchers.  As a side benefit, it is expected that understanding the mathematical models and computational algorithms used to engineer Quantum Computers will also lead to improved algorithms for utilizing Quantum Computers.

Pre-submission
Unless you have been approached directly by the Editor-in-Chief of a journal or another member of its editorial or publishing team, you will need to submit a proposal to guest edit a special issue to the relevant editorial office. If you are contemplating a special issue proposal, you might find the following recommendations helpful.

Preparing a proposal for a special issue
Working together with any other guest editors, you should prepare a proposal that, in addition to observing any special guidelines which are imposed by the journal's guide for authors or special issue guide (if any):

Sets out the importance of the area on which the special issue will focus;

As quoted from Shalf\cite{shalf2020future},
``Moore’s Law [1] is a techno-economic model that has enabled the IT industry to double the performance and functionality of digital electronics roughly every 2 years within a fixed cost, power and area. This expectation has led to a relatively stable ecosystem (e.g. electronic design automation tools, compilers, simulators and emulators) built around general-purpose processor technologies, such as the ×86, ARM and Power instruction set architectures. However, within a decade, the technological underpinnings for the process that Gordon Moore described will come to an end, as lithography gets down to atomic scale. At that point, it will be feasible to create lithographically produced devices with dimensions nearing atomic scale, where a dozen or fewer silicon atoms are present across critical device features, and will therefore represent a practical limit for implementing logic gates for digital computing [2]. Indeed, the ITRS (International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors), which has tracked the historical improvements over the past 30 years, has projected no improvements beyond 2021, as shown in figure 1, and subsequently disbanded, having no further purpose. The classical technological driver that has underpinned Moore’s Law for the past 50 years is failing [3] and is anticipated to flatten by 2025, as shown in figure 2. Evolving technology in the absence of Moore’s Law will require an investment now in computer architecture and the basic sciences (including materials science), to study candidate replacement materials and alternative device physics to foster continued technology scaling.'' References one through three in the above quote 
correspond to the following references respectively: 
\cite{moore2021cramming}\cite{mack2015multiple}\cite{markov2014limits}.

In Figure 3 of the article by Shalf\cite{shalf2020future}, a roadmap is provided for possible paths forward when the density of circuits on classical computers exceeds a critical value.  There are three categories: (a) roadmap for the next ten years, (b) 20 years, and (c) ``Decades beyond exascale,'' ``New Models of Computation.'' For category (c), some of the prospective technology listed is:
(i) approximate computing, (ii) adiabatic reversible, (iii) Analog, (iv) Neuromorhic, and (v) quantum.

Of the ``new models of computation'' listed in 
Shalf's article\cite{shalf2020future}, this special issue will address
the ``Numerical Methods for Engineering Quantum Computers'' aspects associated with the
emerging ``quantum computing'' paradigm.  As outlined by
Gamble\cite{gamble2019quantum}, the development of reliable quantum
computers will have a tranformative effect on computer technology.

\begin{comment}

Indicates the timeframe in which the special issue could be produced (to include paper writing, reviewing and submission of final copy to the journal) assuming the proposal is accepted;
Includes a short biography of all authors and guest editors;
Indicates any special timing, associated events, funding support, partnerships or other links or relationships which could influence the development of the issue;
Provides any further information which you feel is relevant.
A special issue normally contains between five and 20 full-length articles, in addition to an editorial written by the special issue organizers. Because it is highly unlikely that all articles submitted for potential inclusion in a special issue will successfully pass the peer review process, it is wise to consider more papers than you anticipate as the upper limit. If fewer than three articles are accepted for publication, the articles will be published as stand-alone articles in the journal.
Once you're ready, use the link below to find your chosen journal and submit your proposal.
