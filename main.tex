ABSTRACT:
The main techniques in physically storing information in a ``Quantum superposition state'' are (a) trapped ions, (b) superconducting circuits (e.g. Unimon Qubit), (c) Nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond, and (d) Photonic Qubits.  Each of these vehicles for quantum information technology  have their advantages and disadvantages.  Important properties to consider are (i) resiliance to noise, (ii) ability to travel long distances, (iii) decoherence time, (iv) operating temperature, and (v) scalability of multi Qubit entanglement.  Scientists and Engineers answer questions regarding the aforementioned Qubit technology either experimentally or computationally.  In this review article, it is the computational methods which are reported on regarding Quantum information technology and engineering.  That being said, many numerical techniques synergistically use experimental data in order to discover quantum phenomena; i.e. many numerical methods have a data assimilation (i.e. data fusion) component.

Pre-submission
Unless you have been approached directly by the Editor-in-Chief of a journal or another member of its editorial or publishing team, you will need to submit a proposal to guest edit a special issue to the relevant editorial office. If you are contemplating a special issue proposal, you might find the following recommendations helpful.

Preparing a proposal for a special issue
Working together with any other guest editors, you should prepare a proposal that, in addition to observing any special guidelines which are imposed by the journal's guide for authors or special issue guide (if any):

Sets out the importance of the area on which the special issue will focus;
--------------------------------------------

As quoted from Shalf\cite{shalf2020future},
``Moore’s Law [1] is a techno-economic model that has enabled the IT industry to double the performance and functionality of digital electronics roughly every 2 years within a fixed cost, power and area. This expectation has led to a relatively stable ecosystem (e.g. electronic design automation tools, compilers, simulators and emulators) built around general-purpose processor technologies, such as the ×86, ARM and Power instruction set architectures. However, within a decade, the technological underpinnings for the process that Gordon Moore described will come to an end, as lithography gets down to atomic scale. At that point, it will be feasible to create lithographically produced devices with dimensions nearing atomic scale, where a dozen or fewer silicon atoms are present across critical device features, and will therefore represent a practical limit for implementing logic gates for digital computing [2]. Indeed, the ITRS (International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors), which has tracked the historical improvements over the past 30 years, has projected no improvements beyond 2021, as shown in figure 1, and subsequently disbanded, having no further purpose. The classical technological driver that has underpinned Moore’s Law for the past 50 years is failing [3] and is anticipated to flatten by 2025, as shown in figure 2. Evolving technology in the absence of Moore’s Law will require an investment now in computer architecture and the basic sciences (including materials science), to study candidate replacement materials and alternative device physics to foster continued technology scaling.'' References one through three in the above quote 
correspond to the following references respectively: 
\cite{moore2021cramming}\cite{mack2015multiple}\cite{markov2014limits}.

In Figure 3 of the article by Shalf\cite{shalf2020future}, a roadmap is provided for possible paths forward when the density of circuits on classical computers exceeds a critical value.  There are three categories: (a) roadmap for the next ten years, (b) 20 years, and (c) ``Decades beyond exascale,'' ``New Models of Computation.'' For category (c), some of the prospective technology listed is:
(i) approximate computing, (ii) adiabatic reversible, (iii) Analog, (iv) Neuromorhic, and (v) quantum.

Of the ``new models of computation'' listed in 
Shalf's article\cite{shalf2020future}, this special issue will address
the ``Computational Quantum Engineering'' aspects associated with the
emerging ``quantum computing'' paradigm.  As outlined by
Gamble\cite{gamble2019quantum}, the development of reliable quantum
computers will have a tranformative effect on computer technology.



Explains how the anticipated contribution of the special issue will advance understanding in this area;
------------------------------------------------------

There are many academic programs, research lab programs,
research articles, and books, that pertain to
``Quantum Enginnering.''  For example the following are some of the
Universities in the
United States have explicit Quantum Engineering programs: 
``Quantum Science and Engineering'' at Princeton University, 
``Quantum Science and Engineering'' at Harvard Kenneth C. Griffin Graduate
school of arts and sciences, 
``Institute for Quantum Information and Matter (IQIM)'' at the California 
Institute of Technology,
``MIT Quantum Science and Engineering'' at the Massachusettes Institute of 
Technology,
``Quantum Engineering'' at Colorado School of Mines.

At the same time, material addressing the numerical
simulation aspects for designing quantum computers (and peripherals) are
sparsely located, and ``piecemeal'' located.  It is the feeling that
the Journal of Computational Physics is an ideal journal in order to 
report on the latest computational methods for simulating quantum
interactions which are intrinsically related to the development of quantum
devices.  It is believed that having many of the ``Computational Quantum
Engineering'' articles in one place can accelerate the understanding of 
how quantum systems work and induce new discoveries.

Identifies papers and authors for possible inclusion in the special issue, with a brief description of each paper. (These papers do not need to have been written at this time, although it might be the case that work is already in progress.);

Indicates the timeframe in which the special issue could be produced (to include paper writing, reviewing and submission of final copy to the journal) assuming the proposal is accepted;
Includes a short biography of all authors and guest editors;
Indicates any special timing, associated events, funding support, partnerships or other links or relationships which could influence the development of the issue;
Provides any further information which you feel is relevant.
A special issue normally contains between five and 20 full-length articles, in addition to an editorial written by the special issue organizers. Because it is highly unlikely that all articles submitted for potential inclusion in a special issue will successfully pass the peer review process, it is wise to consider more papers than you anticipate as the upper limit. If fewer than three articles are accepted for publication, the articles will be published as stand-alone articles in the journal.
Once you're ready, use the link below to find your chosen journal and submit your proposal.
